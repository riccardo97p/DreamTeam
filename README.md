# Dream Team

An Android application developed in Android Studio with Kotlin for the management and participation in soccer matches between friends, with the possibility to open the participation to outsiders looking for a match around the city.

The project has been developed for a university course in "La Sapienza", Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing, held by Roberto Beraldi.

For the realization of a messaging system we relied on Openfire, hosted on a AWS EC2 instance.
